                  <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
                  <p>My occupation of choice is web designer, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them. As a web designer I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The requirements for this occupation vary with what kind of work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree</p>
